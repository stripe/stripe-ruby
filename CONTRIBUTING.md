# Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions to this project. Your contributions can be code changes in a pull request or reporting bugs and feature requests.

Once you have submitted a pull request, sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) by clicking on the badge in the comment from @CLAassistant.

Please also make sure that any pull request has a corresponding issue filled out with the necessary context. [Click here to create one](https://www.github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/issues/new/choose).

## Generated code

This project has a combination of manually maintained code and code generated from our private code generator. If your contribution involves changes to generated code, please call this out in the issue or pull request as we will likely need to make a change to our code generator before accepting the contribution.

To identify files with purely generated code, look for the comment `File generated from our OpenAPI spec.` at the start of the file. Generated blocks of code within hand-written files will be between comments that say `The beginning of the section generated from our OpenAPI spec` and `The end of the section generated from our OpenAPI spec`. 

## Compatibility with supported platforms

This project supports a wide range of platform versions, and we are unable to accept any contribution that only works on a subset of these versions. If your contribution needs to use a platform API or feature that is only available in some of the supported versions, please call this out explicitly in the issue or pull request. We will do our best to figure out how to help you out here, or plan to accept your pull request later when we can drop support for older versions.

## Set up your dev environment

Please refer to this project's [README.md](README.md#development) for instructions on how to set up your development environment.
