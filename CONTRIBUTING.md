## Generated code

This project has a combination of hand-written code and code generated from our private code generator. Any generated files will have a comment that says "File generated from our OpenAPI spec." Generated blocks of code within hand-written files will be between a comments that says "The beginning of the section generated from our OpenAPI spec" and "The end of the section generated from our OpenAPI spec".
