=== 1.7.9 2013-01-15

  arguments, like Stripe::Invoice#pay (github issue #42)

=== 1.7.3 2012-09-14

* Make sure that both keys and values of GET params are
  URL-encoded. NOTE: If you were previously URL-encoding values
  yourself, you may need to adjust your code.
* URL-encode POST params directly, instead of allowing rest-client to
  do it to work around an unfortunate interaction with the hashery gem
  (github issue #38)

=== 1.7.2 2012-08-31

* Add support for new pay and update methods for Invoice objects

=== 1.7.1 2012-08-15

* Add new Account API resource

=== 1.7.0 2012-05-17

* 3 major enhancements:
  * Switch from vendored stripe-json to multi_json for all JSON
    parsing and rendering. This should not impact programmatic usage
    of the library, but may cause small rendering differences from,
    e.g., StripeObject#inspect (github issue #22)
  * Add new delete_discount method to Customer objects
  * Add new Transfer API resource

* 2 minor enhancements:
  * Switch from HTTP Basic auth to Bearer auth (Note: Stripe will
    support Basic auth for the indefinite future, but recommends
    Bearer auth when possible going forward)
  * Numerous test suite improvements
