=== 1.7.1 2012-08-15

* Add new Account API resource

=== 1.7.0 2012-05-17

* 3 major enhancements:
  * Switch from vendored stripe-json to multi_json for all JSON
    parsing and rendering. This should not impact programmatic usage
    of the library, but may cause small rendering differences from,
    e.g., StripeObject#inspect (github issue #22)
  * Add new delete_discount method to Customer objects
  * Add new Transfer API resource

* 2 minor enhancements:
  * Switch from HTTP Basic auth to Bearer auth (Note: Stripe will
    support Basic auth for the indefinite future, but recommends
    Bearer auth when possible going forward)
  * Numerous test suite improvements
