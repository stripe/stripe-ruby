* Make sure that both keys and values of GET params are
  URL-encoded. NOTE: If you were previously URL-encoding values
  yourself, you may need to adjust your code.

  do it to work around an unfortunate interaction with the hashery gem
  (github issue #38)

  * Add new delete_discount method to Customer objects
  * Add new Transfer API resource

* 2 minor enhancements:
  * Switch from HTTP Basic auth to Bearer auth (Note: Stripe will
    support Basic auth for the indefinite future, but recommends
    Bearer auth when possible going forward)
  * Numerous test suite improvements
