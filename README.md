...features

- configuration.
- page help.
- Track.
- Fresh content.
- Mechanisms for processing payments.

This document aims to recapture the content of [Ruby API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby#intro).

## Installation

Activate and build, with [Ruby 2.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

```sh
gem install stripe
gem build stripe.gemspec
```

### Bundler

If you are installing via bundler,
you should be sure to use the `https rubygems` source in your Gemfile,
as any gems fetched over http are considered compromised.

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails'
gem 'stripe'
```

Set `Stripe.api_key` to your [account key][api-keys]:

```ruby
require "stripe"
Stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."

# list charges
Stripe::Charge.list()

# retrieve single charge
Stripe::Charge.retrieve(
  "ch_18atAXCdGbJFKhCuBAa4532Z",
)
```

### Per-request accounts

[Stripe Connect][connect] allows per-request accountsã€‚

```ruby
require "stripe"

Stripe::Charge.list(
  {},
  {
    api_key: "sk_test_...",
    stripe_account: "acct_...",
    stripe_version: "2018-02-28",
  }
)

Stripe::Charge.retrieve(
  "ch_18atAXCdGbJFKhCuBAa4532Z",
  {
    api_key: "sk_test_...",
    stripe_account: "acct_...",
    stripe_version: "2018-02-28",
  }
)

Stripe::Charge.retrieve(
  {
    id: "ch_18atAXCdGbJFKhCuBAa4532Z",
    expand: %w(balance_transaction)
  },
  {
    stripe_version: "2018-02-28",
    api_key: "sk_test_...",
  }
)
```

### Configuring a Client

While a default HTTP client is used by default, it's also possible to have the
library use any client supported by [Faraday][faraday] by initializing a
`Stripe::StripeClient` object and giving it a connection:

```ruby
conn = Faraday.new
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new(conn)
charge, resp = client.request do
  Stripe::Charge.retrieve(
    "ch_18atAXCdGbJFKhCuBAa4532Z",
  )
end
puts resp.request_id
```

### Configuring a proxy

A proxy can be configured with `Stripe.proxy`:

```ruby
Stripe.proxy = "https://user:pass@example.com:1234"
```

### Configuring an API Version

By default, the library will use the API version pinned to the account making
a request. This can be overridden with this global option:

```ruby
Stripe.api_version = "2018-02-28"
```

See [versioning in the API reference][versioning] for more information.

### Configuring CA Bundles

By default, the library will use its own internal bundle of known CA
certificates, but it's possible to configure your own:

```ruby
Stripe.ca_bundle_path = "path/to/ca/bundle"
```

### Configuring Automatic Retries

The library can be configured to automatically retry requests that fail due to
an intermittent network problem:

```ruby
Stripe.max_network_retries = 2
```

[Idempotency keys][idempotency-keys] are added to requests to guarantee that
retries are safe.

### Configuring Timeouts

Open and read timeouts are configurable:

```ruby
Stripe.open_timeout = 30 // in seconds
Stripe.read_timeout = 80
```

Please take care to set conservative read timeouts. Some API requests can take
some time, and a short timeout increases the likelihood of a problem within our
servers.

### Logging

The library can be configured to emit logging that will give you better insight
into what it's doing. The `info` logging level is usually most appropriate for
production use, but `debug` is also available for more verbosity.

There are a few options for enabling it:

1. Set the environment variable `STRIPE_LOG` to the value `debug` or `info`:

   ```sh
   $ export STRIPE_LOG=info
   ```

2. Set `Stripe.log_level`:

   ```ruby
   Stripe.log_level = Stripe::LEVEL_INFO
   ```

### Writing a Plugin

If you're writing a plugin that uses the library, we'd appreciate it if you
identified using `#set_app_info`:

```ruby
Stripe.set_app_info("MyAwesomePlugin", version: "1.2.34", url: "https://myawesomeplugin.info");
```

This information is passed along when the library makes calls to the Stripe
API.

### Request latency telemetry

By default, the library sends request latency telemetry to Stripe. These
numbers help Stripe improve the overall latency of its API for all users.

You can disable this behavior if you prefer:

```ruby
Stripe.enable_telemetry = false
```

## Development

The test suite depends on [stripe-mock], so make sure to fetch and run it from a
background terminal ([stripe-mock's README][stripe-mock] also contains
instructions for installing via Homebrew and other methods):

```sh
go get -u github.com/stripe/stripe-mock
stripe-mock
```

Run all tests:

```sh
bundle exec rake test
```

Run a single test suite:

```sh
bundle exec ruby -Ilib/ test/stripe/util_test.rb
```

Run a single test:

```sh
bundle exec ruby -Ilib/ test/stripe/util_test.rb -n /should.convert.names.to.symbols/
```

Run the linter:

```sh
bundle exec rake rubocop
```

Update bundled CA certificates from the [Mozilla cURL release][curl]:

```sh
bundle exec rake update_certs
```

Update the bundled [stripe-mock] by editing the version number found in
`.travis.yml`.
