= Stripe Ruby bindings

== Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the gem. If
you just want to use the Stripe Ruby bindings, you should run:

  sudo gem install stripe

If you want to build the gem from source:

  sudo gem build stripe.gemspec

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or above. (Ruby 1.8.6 may work if you load
  ActiveSupport.)
* rest-client, json

== Mirrors

The stripe gem is mirrored on Rubygems, so you should be able to
install it via

  gem install stripe

if desired. We recommend using the https://code.stripe.com mirror so
all code is fetched over SSL.
