= Stripe Ruby bindings {<img src="https://gemnasium.com/stripe/stripe-ruby.png" alt="Dependency Status" />}[https://gemnasium.com/stripe/stripe-ruby]

== Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the gem. If
you just want to use the Stripe Ruby bindings, you should run:

  gem install --source https://code.stripe.com stripe

If you want to build the gem from source:

  gem build stripe.gemspec

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or above. (Ruby 1.8.6 may work if you load
  ActiveSupport.)
* rest-client, multi_json

== Mirrors

The stripe gem is mirrored on Rubygems, so you should be able to
install it via <tt>gem install stripe</tt> if desired. We recommend using 
the https://code.stripe.com mirror so all code is fetched over SSL.

Note that if you are installing via bundler, you should be sure to use the https
rubygems source in your Gemfile, as any gems fetched over http could potentially be
comprimised in transit and alter the code of gems fetched securely over https:

  source 'https://code.stripe.com'
  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  
  gem 'rails'
  gem 'stripe'

== Development

Test cases can be run with: `bundle exec rake test`
