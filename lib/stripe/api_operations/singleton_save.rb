        #   object values) to be added to the request. E.g. to allow for an
        #   idempotency_key to be passed in the request headers, or for the
        #   api_key to be overwritten. See

      # If the resource doesn't yet have an assigned ID and the resource is one
      # that can be created, then the method attempts to create the resource.
      # The resource is updated otherwise.

      # ==== Attributes
      #
      # * +params+ - Overrides any parameters in the resource's serialized data
      #   and includes them in the create or update. If +:req_url:+ is included
      #   in the list, it overrides the update URL used for the create or
      #   update.
      # * +opts+ - A Hash of additional options (separate from the params /
      #   object values) to be added to the request. E.g. to allow for an
      #   idempotency_key to be passed in the request headers, or for the
      #   api_key to be overwritten. See
      #   {APIOperations::Request.execute_resource_request}.
      def save(params = {}, opts = {})
        # We started unintentionally (sort of) allowing attributes sent to
        # +save+ to override values used during the update. So as not to break
        # the API, this makes that official here.
