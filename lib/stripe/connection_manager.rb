module Stripe

  # library may connect to multiple hosts during a typical session (main API,
  # Connect, Uploads). Ruby doesn't provide an easy way to make this happen
  # easily, so this class is designed to track what we're connected to and
  # manage the lifecycle of those connections.

  # Note that this class in itself is *not* thread safe. We expect it to be
  # instantiated once per thread.
