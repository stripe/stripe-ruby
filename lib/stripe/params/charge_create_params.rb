For more information, see the [authorizing charges and settling later](https://stripe.com/docs/charges/placing-a-hold) documentation.

For certain sources---namely, [cards](https://stripe.com/docs/api#cards), [bank accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#bank_accounts), and attached [sources](https://stripe.com/docs/api#sources)---you must also pass the ID of the associated customer.

    # For a non-card charge, text that appears on the customer's statement as the statement descriptor. This value overrides the account's default statement descriptor. For information about requirements, including the 22-character limit, see [the Statement Descriptor docs](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).

    # For a card charge, this value is ignored unless you don't specify a `statement_descriptor_suffix`, in which case this value is used as the suffix.
    attr_accessor :statement_descriptor

If the account has no prefix value, the suffix is concatenated to the account's statement descriptor.
