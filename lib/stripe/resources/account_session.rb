module Stripe
  # An AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.
  #
  # We recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component
  # to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively
  # quickly, and cannot be used more than once.
