module Stripe
  # This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see
  # the balance currently on your Stripe account.
  #
  # You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of
  # [transactions](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance
  # (charges, payouts, and so forth).
  #
  # The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by
  # payment source types.
