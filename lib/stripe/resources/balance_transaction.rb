    attr_reader :currency
    # An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
    attr_reader :description
    # If applicable, this transaction uses an exchange rate. If money converts from currency A to currency B, then the `amount` in currency A, multipled by the `exchange_rate`, equals the `amount` in currency B. For example, if you charge a customer 10.00 EUR, the PaymentIntent's `amount` is `1000` and `currency` is `eur`. If this converts to 12.34 USD in your Stripe account, the BalanceTransaction's `amount` is `1234`, its `currency` is `usd`, and the `exchange_rate` is `1.234`.
    attr_reader :exchange_rate
    # Fees (in cents (or local equivalent)) paid for this transaction. Represented as a positive integer when assessed.

    # Unique identifier for the object.
    attr_reader :id
    # Net impact to a Stripe balance (in cents (or local equivalent)). A positive value represents incrementing a Stripe balance, and a negative value decrementing a Stripe balance. You can calculate the net impact of a transaction on a balance by `amount` - `fee`
