    # The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and
    # billing management.
    #
    # A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you
    # want to provide to your customers through the portal.
    #
    # A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
    # a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
    # can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
    # sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
    # Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
    # and billing details.
