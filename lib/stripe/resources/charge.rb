  # The `Charge` object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.
  # PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges, but transferring
  # money to a different Stripe account through Connect also creates Charges.
  # Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is not recommended for new integrations.
