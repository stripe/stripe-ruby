    # A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for
    # one-time purchases or subscriptions through [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout)
    # or [Payment Links](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-links). We recommend creating a
    # new Session each time your customer attempts to pay.
    #
    # Once payment is successful, the Checkout Session will contain a reference
    # to the [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers), and either the successful
    # [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) or an active
    # [Subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).
    #
    # You can create a Checkout Session on your server and redirect to its URL
    # to begin Checkout.
