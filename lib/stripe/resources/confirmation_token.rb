  # ConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over
  # to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation
  # is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.
  #
  # To learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:
  # - [Finalize payments on the server](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)
