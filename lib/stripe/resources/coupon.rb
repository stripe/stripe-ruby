  # A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you
  # might want to apply to a customer. Coupons may be applied to [subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/api#subscriptions), [invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoices),
  # [checkout sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions), [quotes](https://stripe.com/docs/api#quotes), and more. Coupons do not work with conventional one-off [charges](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_charge) or [payment intents](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents).
