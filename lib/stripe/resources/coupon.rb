module Stripe
  # A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you
  # might want to apply to a customer. Coupons may be applied to [subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/api#subscriptions), [invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoices),
  # [checkout sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions), [quotes](https://stripe.com/docs/api#quotes), and more. Coupons do not work with conventional one-off [charges](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_charge) or [payment intents](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents).

    # You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.
    #
    # A coupon has either a percent_off or an amount_off and currency. If you set an amount_off, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice's subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 will have a final total of 0 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 will have a final total of 100 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200 is applied to it.
