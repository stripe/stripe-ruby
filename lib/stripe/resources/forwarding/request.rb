module Stripe
  module Forwarding
    # Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL
    # is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials
    # provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.
    #
    # Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers,
    # before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a
    # 30-day retention period.
    #
    # You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one
    # outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency
    # keys provided on the underlying third-party request.
    #
    # Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to
    # Stripe's limits.
    #
