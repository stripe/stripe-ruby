  # Each customer has a [`balance`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-balance) that is
  # automatically applied to future invoices and payments using the `customer_balance` payment method.
  # Customers can fund this balance by initiating a bank transfer to any account in the
  # `financial_addresses` field.
