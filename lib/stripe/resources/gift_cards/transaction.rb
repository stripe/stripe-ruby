    # A gift card transaction represents a single transaction on a referenced gift card.
    # A transaction is in one of three states, `confirmed`, `held` or `canceled`. A `confirmed`
    # transaction is one that has added/deducted funds. A `held` transaction has created a
    # temporary hold on funds, which can then be cancelled or confirmed. A `held` transaction
    # can be confirmed into a `confirmed` transaction, or canceled into a `canceled` transaction.
    # A `canceled` transaction has no effect on a gift card's balance.
