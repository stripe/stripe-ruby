    # A VerificationSession guides you through the process of collecting and verifying the identities
    # of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [verification
    # check](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for
    # each verification in your system.
    #
    # A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple
    # statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/how-sessions-work) throughout its lifetime as it progresses through
    # the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the user's verified data after
    # verification checks are complete.
