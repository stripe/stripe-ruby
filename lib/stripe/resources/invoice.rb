module Stripe
  # Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
  # generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
  #
  # They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
  # that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
  #
  # If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
  # Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
  # that finalizing the invoice,
  # [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
  # not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
  # until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
  # webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
  # connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
  # creation to finalize the invoice.
  #
  # If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
  # [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
  # Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
  # emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
  #
  # Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
  # amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
  # charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
  # per currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
  # invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
  # customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
  #
  # More details on the customer's credit balance are
  # [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

    # At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.

    # Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview â€“ the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer's discount.
    #
    # You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a proration_date parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the subscription_proration_date returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where period[start] is equal to the subscription_proration_date on the upcoming invoice resource.
