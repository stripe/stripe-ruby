module Stripe
  # A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
  # We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
  # customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
  # see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.
  #
  # A PaymentIntent transitions through
  # [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
  # throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
  # authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.
