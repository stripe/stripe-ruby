  # A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
  # We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
  # customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
  # see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.
  #
  # A PaymentIntent transitions through
  # [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
  # throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
  # authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

      # A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
      # For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
      # Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
      #
      # Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
      # Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
      # The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
      # you through the setup process.
      #
      # Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
      # For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
      # [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
      # to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).
      # If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
      # it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
      # We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
      # PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
