module Stripe
  # A payment link is a shareable URL that will take your customers to a hosted payment page. A payment link can be shared and used multiple times.
  #
  # When a customer opens a payment link it will open a new [checkout session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions) to render the payment page. You can use [checkout session events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) to track payments through payment links.
