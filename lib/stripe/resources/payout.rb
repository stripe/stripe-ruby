  # A `Payout` object is created when you receive funds from Stripe, or when you
  # initiate a payout to either a bank account or debit card of a [connected
  # Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/bank-debit-card-payouts). You can retrieve individual payouts,
  # and list all payouts. Payouts are made on [varying
  # schedules](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/manage-payout-schedule), depending on your country and
  # industry.
