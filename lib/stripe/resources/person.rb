module Stripe
  # This is an object representing a person associated with a Stripe account.
  #
  # A platform cannot access a person for an account where [account.controller.requirement_collection](https://stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection) is `stripe`, which includes Standard and Express accounts, after creating an Account Link or Account Session to start Connect onboarding.
  #
  # See the [Standard onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts) or [Express onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) documentation for information about prefilling information and account onboarding steps. Learn more about [handling identity verification with the API](https://stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#person-information).
