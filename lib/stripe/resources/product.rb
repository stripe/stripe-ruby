module Stripe
  # Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.
  # For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product.
  # They can be used in conjunction with [Prices](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices) to configure pricing in Payment Links, Checkout, and Subscriptions.
