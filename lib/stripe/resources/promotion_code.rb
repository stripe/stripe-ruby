  # A Promotion Code represents a customer-redeemable code for an underlying promotion.
  # You can create multiple codes for a single promotion.
  #
  # If you enable promotion codes in your [customer portal configuration](https://stripe.com/docs/customer-management/configure-portal), then customers can redeem a code themselves when updating a subscription in the portal.
  # Customers can also view the currently active promotion codes and coupons on each of their subscriptions in the portal.
