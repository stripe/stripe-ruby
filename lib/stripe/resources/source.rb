module Stripe
  # `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
  # represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
  # just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
  # attached to customers.
  #
  # Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).
  # We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
  # This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method types.
  #
  # Related guides: [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) and [Sources & Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/customers).
