    # `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
    # represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
    # just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
    # attached to customers.

    # Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).
    # We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
    # This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method types.
    #
    # Related guides: [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) and [Sources & Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/customers).
