    #
    # For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.
    #
    # A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.
    #
    # A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status unchanged.
    #
    # If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings).
    #
    # If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.

    # Updates an existing subscription to match the specified parameters.
    # When changing prices or quantities, we optionally prorate the price we charge next month to make up for any price changes.
    # To preview how the proration is calculated, use the [create preview](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/create_preview) endpoint.
    #
    # By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a 100 price, they'll be billed 100 immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a 200 price, then on June 1 they'll be billed 250 (200 for a renewal of her subscription, plus a 50 prorating adjustment for half of the previous month's 100 difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.
    #
    # Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless:
    #
    #
    # The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).
    # The subscription moves from free to paid.
    # A trial starts or ends.
    #
    #
    # In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date. Learn about how [Stripe immediately attempts payment for subscription changes](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade#immediate-payment).
    #
    # If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass proration_behavior as always_invoice to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass create_prorations, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription's renewal date, you need to manually [invoice the customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/create).
    #
    # If you don't want to prorate, set the proration_behavior option to none. With this option, the customer is billed 100 on May 1 and 200 on June 1. Similarly, if you set proration_behavior to none when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don't generate any credits for the old subscription's unused time. We still reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.
    #
    # Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may result in [rate limiting. If you need to bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based">usage-based billing](https://stripe.com/docs/rate-limits) instead.
