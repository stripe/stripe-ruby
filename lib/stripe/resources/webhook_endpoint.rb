module Stripe
  # You can configure [webhook endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/) via the API to be
  # notified about events that happen in your Stripe account or connected
  # accounts.
  #
  # Most users configure webhooks from [the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks), which provides a user interface for registering and testing your webhook endpoints.
