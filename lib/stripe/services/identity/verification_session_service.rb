      # A VerificationSession object can be redacted when it is in requires_input or verified
      # [status](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/how-sessions-work). Redacting a VerificationSession in requires_action
      # state will automatically cancel it.

      # VerificationSession's redaction.status field will be set to processing; when the process is
      # finished, it will change to redacted and an identity.verification_session.redacted event
      # will be emitted.
      #
      # Redaction is irreversible. Redacted objects are still accessible in the Stripe API, but all the
      # fields that contain personal data will be replaced by the string [redacted] or a similar
      # placeholder. The metadata field will also be erased. Redacted objects cannot be updated or
      # used for any purpose.
