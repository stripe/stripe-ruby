      # Indicates if a plan's `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `subscription_trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `subscription_trial_end` is not allowed. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials) to learn more.
