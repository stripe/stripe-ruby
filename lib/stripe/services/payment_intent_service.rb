    # the PaymentIntent transitions to the requires_payment_method status or the
    # canceled status if the confirmation limit is reached. If
    # payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the succeeded
    # status (or requires_capture, if capture_method is set to manual).

    # confirmation is required to complete the payment.

    # initiated using a secret key.

    # return to the requires_confirmation state

    # explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment
    # attempt.
