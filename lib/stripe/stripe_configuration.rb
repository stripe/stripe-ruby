module Stripe
  # Configurable options:
  #
  # =ca_bundle_path=
  # The location of a file containing a bundle of CA certificates. By default
  # the library will use an included bundle that can successfully validate
  # Stripe certificates.
  #
  # =log_level=
  # When set prompts the library to log some extra information to $stdout and
  # $stderr about what it's doing. For example, it'll produce information about
  # requests, responses, and errors that are received. Valid log levels are
  # `debug` and `info`, with `debug` being a little more verbose in places.
  #
  # Use of this configuration is only useful when `.logger` is _not_ set. When
  # it is, the decision what levels to print is entirely deferred to the logger.
  #
  # =logger=
  # The logger should support the same interface as the `Logger` class that's
  # part of Ruby's standard library (hint, anything in `Rails.logger` will
  # likely be suitable).
  #
  # If `.logger` is set, the value of `.log_level` is ignored. The decision on
  # what levels to print is entirely deferred to the logger.
