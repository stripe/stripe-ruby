  # Each customer has a [Balance](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-balance) value,
  # which denotes a debit or credit that's automatically applied to their next invoice upon finalization.
  # You may modify the value directly by using the [update customer API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/update),
  # or by creating a Customer Balance Transaction, which increments or decrements the customer's `balance` by the specified `amount`.
  #
  # Related guide: [Customer balance](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance)
