module Stripe
  # Snapshot events allow you to track and react to activity in your Stripe integration. When
  # the state of another API resource changes, Stripe creates an `Event` object that contains
  # all the relevant information associated with that action, including the affected API
  # resource. For example, a successful payment triggers a `charge.succeeded` event, which
  # contains the `Charge` in the event's data property. Some actions trigger multiple events.
  # For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, it triggers both a
  # `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.
  #
  # Configure an event destination in your account to listen for events that represent actions
  # your integration needs to respond to. Additionally, you can retrieve an individual event or
  # a list of events from the API.
  #
  # [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can also receive event notifications
  # that occur in their connected accounts. These events include an account attribute that
  # identifies the relevant connected account.
  #
  # You can access events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events#retrieve_event)
  # for 30 days.
