  # Invoice Payments represent payments made against invoices. Invoice Payments can
  # be accessed in two ways:
  # 1. By expanding the `payments` field on the [Invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoice) resource.
  # 2. By using the Invoice Payment retrieve and list endpoints.
  #
  # Invoice Payments include the mapping between payment objects, such as Payment Intent, and Invoices.
  # This resource and its endpoints allows you to easily track if a payment is associated with a specific invoice and
  # monitor the allocation details of the payments.
