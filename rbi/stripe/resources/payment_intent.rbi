  # A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
  # We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
  # customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
  # see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.
  #
  # A PaymentIntent transitions through
  # [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
  # throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
  # authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

      # you through the setup process.
      #
      # Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
      # For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
      # [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
      # to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).

      # We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
      # PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
