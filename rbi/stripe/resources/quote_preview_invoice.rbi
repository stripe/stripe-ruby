  # Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
  # generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
  #
  # They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
  # that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
  #
  # If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
  # Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
  # that finalizing the invoice,
  # [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
  # not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
  # until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
  # webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
  # connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
  # creation to finalize the invoice.
  #
  # If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
  # [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
  # Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
  # emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
  #
  # Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
  # amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
  # charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
  # per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
  # invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
  # customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
  #
  # More details on the customer's credit balance are
  # [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

      # Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
      # For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
      # [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
