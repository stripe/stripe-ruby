module Stripe
  # [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
  # connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
  # to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
  # platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.
  #
  # Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
  # charge](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
  # the charge. It is possible to reverse a
  # [transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options)
  # transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
  # reversal.
