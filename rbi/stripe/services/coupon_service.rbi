    # You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.
    #
    # A coupon has either a percent_off or an amount_off and currency. If you set an amount_off, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice's subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 will have a final total of 0 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 will have a final total of 100 if a coupon with an amount_off of 200 is applied to it.

    # You can delete coupons via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. However, deleting a coupon does not affect any customers who have already applied the coupon; it means that new customers can't redeem the coupon. You can also delete coupons via the API.
