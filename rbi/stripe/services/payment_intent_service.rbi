    # a payment.

    # If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the
    # PaymentIntent will transition to the requires_action status and
    # suggest additional actions via next_action. If payment fails,
    # the PaymentIntent transitions to the requires_payment_method status or the
    # canceled status if the confirmation limit is reached. If
    # payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the succeeded
    # status (or requires_capture, if capture_method is set to manual).
    #
    # If the confirmation_method is automatic, payment may be attempted
    # using our [client SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment)
    # and the PaymentIntent's [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intent_object-client_secret).
    # After next_actions are handled by the client, no additional
    # confirmation is required to complete the payment.
    #
    # If the confirmation_method is manual, all payment attempts must be
    # initiated using a secret key.
    #
    # If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will
    # return to the requires_confirmation state
    # after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then
    # explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment
    # attempt.
    #
    # There is a variable upper limit on how many times a PaymentIntent can be confirmed.
    # After this limit is reached, any further calls to this endpoint will
    # transition the PaymentIntent to the canceled state.

    # Incremental authorizations attempt to increase the authorized amount on
    # your customer's card to the new, higher amount provided. Similar to the
    # initial authorization, incremental authorizations can be declined. A
    # single PaymentIntent can call this endpoint multiple times to further
    # increase the authorized amount.

    # If the incremental authorization succeeds, the PaymentIntent object
    # returns with the updated
    # [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount).

    # object remains capturable for the previously authorized amount.
