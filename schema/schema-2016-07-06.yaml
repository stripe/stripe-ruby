If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>10</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of 2000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>30</currency> will have a final total of <currency>10</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of 2000 is applied to it.</p>

        <p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. You may want to consult our <a href="http://127.0.0.1:6040/help/dispute-types">guide to dispute types</a> to help you figure out which evidence fields to provide.</p>

        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discount that is applicable to the customer.</p>

        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice resource.</p>

By default, the subscription is terminated immediately. In either case, the customer will not be charged again for the subscription. Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created will still be charged for at the end of the period unless manually <a href="#delete_invoiceitem">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription to cancel at period end, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected at the end of the period, but if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed.</p>

        <p>By default, all unpaid invoices for the customer will be closed upon subscription cancellation. We do this in order to prevent unexpected payment retries once the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can reopen the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed with automatic retries, or you could even re-attempt payment yourself on all unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>
