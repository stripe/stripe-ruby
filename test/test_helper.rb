  # For our next generation we want to test with some slightly more
  # sophisticated techniques so we don't want these monkey patches applied.
  # This introduces some testing infrastructure that allows them to be disabled
  # conditionally using a helper that takes a block. Unfortunately the mechanic
  # uses a pseudo-global variable to work, but should be a short-lived measure.
